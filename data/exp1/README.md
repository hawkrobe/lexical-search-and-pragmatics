# data explanation

## exp1-raw.csv
This file contains the raw data from Experiment 1. 57 dyads (N = 114) played the Connector game. Each participant was randomly assigned the role of a speaker or guesser for the duration of the game. Speakers were provided a word pair (e.g.,cave-knight) from a 20-word board and had to find a one-word clue that would enable the guesser to identify that word pair from the same board. The order in which the word pairs were presented to the speaker was randomized. Before generating the clues and guesses, speakers and guessers were asked to generate 3-8 candidates. During this candidate selection phase, speakers were encouraged to type in any word that popped into mind before selecting a final clue, whereas guessers were asked to click on as many words on the board as they deemed to be possible correct answers. Participant dyads played 30 rounds across 10 different boards, with 3 word pairs on each board of varying difficulty. 

The data file contains the following columns:
`clueGiverID`: The specific ID of the clue giver (i.e., speaker) in the game
`clueGiverRandCode`: A random code assigned to the speaker
`guesserID`: The specific ID of the guesser in the game
`guesserRandCode`: A random code assigned to the guesser
`target1`: The first target word in the word pair presented to the speaker
`target2`: The second target word in the word pair presented to the speaker

**Note**: All clueOptions were generated on the same screen, so the times are relative to the start of the clue generation screen. The times are in milliseconds.

`clueOption1`: The first candidate clue generated by the speaker <br>
`TBOption1`: The time at which the first candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption1`: The time at which the first candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption2`: The second candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption2`: The time at which the second candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption2`: The time at which the second candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption3`: The third candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption3`: The time at which the third candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption3`: The time at which the third candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption4`: The fourth candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption4`: The time at which the fourth candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption4`: The time at which the fourth candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption5`: The fifth candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption5`: The time at which the fifth candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption5`: The time at which the fifth candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption6`: The sixth candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption6`: The time at which the sixth candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption6`: The time at which the sixth candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption7`: The seventh candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption7`: The time at which the seventh candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption7`: The time at which the seventh candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`clueOption8`: The eighth candidate clue generated by the speaker<br>
`TBOption8`: The time at which the eighth candidate clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEOption8`: The time at which the eighth candidate clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>

**Note**: The final clue was generated on a separate screen, so the times are relative to the start of the final clue generation screen. The times are in milliseconds.
`clueFinal`: The final clue selected by the speaker<br>
`TBFinal`: The time at which the final clue started being generated (first keypress), in milliseconds<br>
`TEFinal`: The time at which the final clue was submitted (last keypress), in milliseconds<br>
**Note**: The guesser was presented with the final clue on a separate screen and asked to click on 3-8 guess candidates on this screen, so the times are relative to the start of the final clue presentation screen. The times are in milliseconds.

**Note** Some of the responses/RTs for GuessOptions 3-8 were copied over from previous rows due to a bug in the data recording in the software/interface. 

`GuessOption1`: The first candidate guess word clicked by the guesser<br>
`GUESS_OPTION1_TIME`: The time at which the first candidate guess word was clicked, in milliseconds<br>
`GuessOption2`: The second candidate guess word clicked by the guesser<br>
`GUESS_OPTION2_TIME`: The time at which the second candidate guess word was clicked, in milliseconds<br>
